    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Sarojini Naidu</h1>
    <p><b><em>Sarojini Naidu (13 February 1879 – 2 March 1949)</b></em> was an Indian political activist and poet who served as the first Governor of United Provinces, after India's independence. She played an important role in the Indian independence movement against the British Raj. She was the first Indian woman to be president of the Indian National Congress and appointed governor of a state.Born in a Bengali family in Hyderabad, Naidu was educated in Madras, London and Cambridge. Following her time in Britain, where she worked as a suffragist, she was drawn to the Congress party's struggle for India's independence. She became a part of the national movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and his idea of swaraj (self rule). She was appointed Congress president in 1925 and, when India achieved its independence, became Governor of the United Provinces in 1947.</p>

<p>Sarojini Naidu passed her matriculation examination to qualify for university study, earning the highest rank, in 1891, when she was twelve. <b>From 1895 to 1898 she studied in England, at King's College, London and then Girton College, Cambridge, with a scholarship from the Nizam of Hyderabad</b>. In England, she met artists from the Aesthetic and Decadent movements.Chattopadhyay returned to Hyderabad in 1898. That same year, she married Govindaraju Naidu, a physician whom she met during her stay in England, in an inter-caste marriage which has been called “groundbreaking and scandalous". Both their families approved their marriage, which was long and harmonious. They had five children. Their daughter Padmaja also joined the Quit India Movement, and she held several governmental positions in independent India.</p>

<p>Naidu utilized her poetry and oratory skills to promote women’s rights alongside the nationalist movement. <b>In 1902, Naidu entered the world of politics after being urged by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, an important leader of the nationalist movement. In 1906, Naidu spoke to the Social Council of Calcutta in order to advocate for the education of Indian women.</b> In her speech, Naidu stressed that the success of the whole movement relied upon the “woman question”. Naidu claimed that the true “nation-builders” were women, not men, and that without women’s active cooperation, the nationalist movement would be in vain. Naidu’s speech argued that Indian nationalism depended on women’s rights, and that the liberation of India could not be separated from the liberation of women. The women’s movement developed parallel to the independence movement for this reason.</p>
